# Flutter DeepAR DC / Web Example

I created a web example where `DeepARChannel` is exposed in `lib/js/channel.js`. Also added some extra scripts to help while previewing the live demo.

## Getting Started

To try out the web version you can visit https://deepar.damoncoding.ca and see a live version of web working on the site.

All you need to start is VS Code with WebDevelopment plugins to run the project. I would recommend getting Live Server plugin, from VS Code to run a local host server and develop on top of what I have created.

You can use the JS file too on your projects. I will create a package release for it if necessary.

## Installing

- Get the latest JS package from https://developer.deepar.ai
- If you plan to deploy the app you need to change the API key referenced in the `channel.js` file.
- That should be it.
